# AI - Underwater Rock vs Mine Detection

This project aims to develop a predictive model that distinguishes between underwater rocks and mines using advanced sonar data analysis and machine learning algorithms. Accurate identification of underwater objects is critical for maritime security, and this project leverages Logistic Regression to enhance the detection process.

By analyzing sonar datasets, our model classifies each input as either a rock or a mine. This capability is essential for ensuring safe navigation and preventing potential maritime hazards. The project combines the power of machine learning with sonar technology, providing a robust solution for underwater object detection.

## Overview

The core of this project is a machine learning model that classifies sonar signals to identify whether the detected object is a rock or a mine. By training the model on labeled sonar data, we create a system capable of making accurate predictions in real-time. This technology has significant implications for maritime navigation, safety, and security, helping to prevent accidents and detect potential threats in underwater environments.
